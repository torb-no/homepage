[House of Salmon](https://www.laksenshus.no/?lang=en) is a visitation for aquaculture. Here students and other can learn about how salmon farming works and it‘s history.

While working for [Back](https://back.no/laksens-hus-1) I designed and programmed experiences for several interactive installations and smartphone.

This included a phone app that allows participants to register points, activate various installations and play mini games connected to various installations. I worked on software for several installations, including a 3D game where you drive a boat to gather tokens tokens representing food for salmon.
