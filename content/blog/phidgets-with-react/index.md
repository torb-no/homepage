# Using Phidgets with React

## What is Phidgets?
[https://www.phidgets.com](https://www.phidgets.com) Phidgets are collection of sensors, input devices and controllers for computers. For example, you can hook up Phidgets [sensors](https://www.phidgets.com/?tier=0&catid=3&pcid=12) to your computer and have your apps be affected by them. Maybe you want to control a physical device like a motor with your programs?

All this might make you think of Arduino. Arduino is similar in that it's an electronics platforms, but Phidgets is different in that it's specifically made to be used with computers (or other devices). It's not a standalone microcontroller like Arduino. You also program them in a much easier and more high level way compared to Arduino. Arduino has it's place, but if all you want is some sensor input input or physical controls in your apps, then Phidgets is something you should consider.
