# Designing and developing experiences

Iâ€™m a front-end developer, interaction designer and creative technologist. I've worked on everything from websites, web-apps, interactive installations to e-learning courses.

## Experience and education

Currently I work as a web developer and designer for [Omega 365](https://www.omega365.com/), and I have also done UI design, information architecture among other things for them in the past.

I've also worked for [Back](https://back.no) where I designed and programmed interactive installations, games and other interactive experiences for museums and visitation centers. I also created temporary interactive installations for [Oslo Children's Museum](https://oslobarnemuseum.org/en/). You can get more details on what I worked in my [portfolio](/projects).

For my bachelor I studied at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), with a focus on interaction design, informatics and media theory. I previously studied interaction design at [Kristiania University College](https://www.kristiania.no/en/).
