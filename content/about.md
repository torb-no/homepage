# Interaction designer and front-end developer

Iâ€™m an interaction designer and a front-end developer. I've worked on everything from corporate websites, enterprise web-apps to interactive installations.

## Work

Currently I work as a web designer and developer for [Omega 365](https://www.omega365.com/), and I have also done UI design, information architecture among other things for them in the past.

I've also worked for [Back](https://back.no) where I designed and programmed interactive installations, games and other interactive experiences. I have also created temporary interactive installations for [Oslo Children's Museum](https://oslobarnemuseum.org/en/). You can get more details on what I worked in my [portfolio](/projects)

For my bachelor I studied at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), with a focus on interaction design, informatics and media theory. I previously studied interaction design at [Kristiania University College](https://www.kristiania.no/en/).
