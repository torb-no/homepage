      <description>Magical drawing installation for kids Creative Technology, Prototyping, C++, openFrameworks, Processing, Arduino, Grove System While studying at University of Oslo I collaborated on a project to prototype interactive installations for Oslo Children‘s Museum. Together with my group I iterated on ideas, eventually landing on an experience where kids could draw on magical screen alone or with others. When several used it together the installation implicitly encouraged collaboration.
This drawing machine controlled by holding hands over distance sensors by ”pushing” in the pair the direction you want the virtual pen to go.</description>

      <description>Sound Painter Creative Technology, Prototyping, Processing In co-operation with Nora Tessem I created a prototype for an interactive installations that let‘s people make noise to throw virtual paint at a screen. The colour of the paint is based on the pitch of the sound and the intensity matches the volume.
Kids are often expected to sit and be quiet. We noticed that many of them found it especially fun that they where supposed to make a lot of noise.</description>

      <description>Omega 365&amp;rsquo;s web-based editor Front-end Development, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery Large parts of Omega 365&amp;rsquo;s developer tools are entirely web based. I worked on the UI design and front-end code for the editor and IDE used to create user facing webapps and websites. This was also used as a basis for other tools such as a SQL management tool. I also created tools for autogenerating code used both as a learning tool and for speeding up development.</description>
